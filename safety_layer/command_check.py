"""The second safety check: looking at one actual order.

The first check (safety_policy.py) answers "is descending allowed right now?"
This one answers "is THIS specific order safe to send?" -- for example,
"fly to 200 metres east, 40 metres up, at 9 m/s".

If an order is unsafe we hand back a SAFE REPLACEMENT, never a bare "no".
The integration plan is explicit about this: simply not sending a command
would leave the drone chasing whatever target it already had.

Order shape comes from Motion's shared contract, so Safety and Motion agree
on field names. That file is expected to move to state_machine/contracts.py
later; only the import below should need changing.
