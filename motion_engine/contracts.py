"""Motion Engine side of the shared Phase-0 contract (INTEGRATION_README.md §4).

The integration README asks every module to talk to the central coordinator
through one versioned contract (`schema_version = 1`): commands go *in*,
an acknowledgement comes straight back, and feedback reports progress on
later ticks. This file holds the Motion Engine's half of that contract:

* `Command`         -- what the coordinator dispatches after Safety approves it
* `CommandAck`      -- Motion's immediate answer: accepted or rejected, and why
* `VehicleFeedback` -- the `vehicle` section of the snapshot, read each tick

plus the value types they share (`Pose`, `MotionCommandType`), a stable set
of reason strings, a simulation clock, and a tiny in-memory log sink.

PROVISIONAL LOCATION: the README suggests the shared types eventually live in
`state_machine/contracts.py` and the logger in `state_machine/logging_format.py`,
owned by the state-machine team. Neither exists yet. Until they do, the
Motion types live here with the README's field names, so moving them is a
cut-and-paste plus a re-export, not a rename.

Conventions (README §4):

* Time is integer simulation nanoseconds (`timestamp_ns`), starting at 0.
  Wall time is never used for a decision.
* Position is local ENU metres (x east, y north, z up), pad and ground at
  z = 0. Yaw is degrees, 0 = east, counter-clockwise positive.
* A missing required field is a *validation result* (a rejection with a
  reason), never a silently-filled "safe" default.
